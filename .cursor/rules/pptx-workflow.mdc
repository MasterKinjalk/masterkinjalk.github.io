# PowerPoint workflow

- The user has **pptx2md** installed (pip). Use it to "read" PowerPoint files.
- Workflow: run `pptx2md <file.pptx> -o <name>.md -i img` (or equivalent), then the assistant reads the generated `.md` and the `img/` folder to work with slide content.
- Images are preserved in the output; the assistant can read those image files when they are in the workspace.
