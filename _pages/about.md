excerpt: "Computer vision for plant biology—root phenotyping, minirhizotron imaging, and software for data-driven plant science."
---

I am **Kinjalk Parth**. I work in **Dr. Andrew Leakey's lab** at the **Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology**, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Our group collects over 100k minirhizotron images each field season; manual analysis is labor-intensive and limits scalability—so I focus on **computer vision and software** to make root phenotyping faster and more reliable.

**Research focus**

I use computer vision to address problems in plant biology and to make **quantification of plant traits** easier. I am also interested in **software solutions** that help plant biologists navigate a world where data has increased manyfold—making tools and pipelines that bridge imaging, machine learning, and biological interpretation. My work spans **automated trait regression** (RootQuant), **foundation-model-based segmentation** (RootSAM), and **integrated desktop software** (SPROUTS) so biologists can go from raw minirhizotron images to biological discovery without juggling multiple tools.

**Recent highlights**

- **NAPPN 2026:** Presented **RootQuant** (automated root length and area from minirhizotron images using deep learning) as a fast-forward talk and poster—my second year at NAPPN. RootQuant acts as a *universal backbone*: fine-tune on your species with minimal trait data.
- **CVPPA 2025 (ICCV workshop):** Two extended abstracts with lightning talks: **RootSAM** (adapting SAM2.1 for root segmentation—37% mIoU gain, 91% cost reduction) and **SPROUTS** (integrated desktop app for high-throughput root phenotyping, from raw image to discovery in a single session).

**Education & background**

- **M.C.S. (Master of Computer Science), University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)** — GPA 3.93/4.00; focus on data-driven and computational methods.
- **B.Tech. in CSE (AI & ML), SRM Institute of Science and Technology** (2019–2023).
- Coursework and certifications in **computer vision** (NPTEL), **natural language processing** (NPTEL), **advanced probability and statistical inference** (NPTEL), **image classification with CNNs** (Coursera), and **data analytics in finance** (UIUC). Also certified in **Python**, **SQL**, and **problem solving** (HackerRank).

**Technical skills & code**

Beyond research, I work in **data engineering**, **data visualization**, and **data science**, with experience in **SaaS development**, **business analytics**, and **Android / mobile development**. I use **Python**, **R**, **MySQL**, **C/C++**, **Dart**, and ML stacks (**PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **Scikit-Learn**, **Pandas**) and have used **Google Cloud**, **Azure**, and **AWS**. You can see more of my projects and code on **[GitHub](https://github.com/MasterKinjalk)** — including work on transport routing, sentiment analysis, object recognition apps, and big-data setups (e.g. Hadoop/Spark on Docker).

**Languages**

**English** and **Hindi** — native or bilingual proficiency.
