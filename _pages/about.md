I am **Kinjalk Parth**. I work in **Dr. Andrew Leakey's lab** at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I focus on **computer vision for plant biology**.

**Research focus**

I use computer vision to address problems in plant biology and to make **quantification of plant traits** easier. I am also interested in **software solutions** that help plant biologists navigate a world where data has increased manyfold—making tools and pipelines that bridge imaging, machine learning, and biological interpretation.

**Background**

I did my **M.S. at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**. I have presented **two abstracts at CVPPA 2025** (Computer Vision for Plant Phenotyping and Agriculture), an ICCV 2025 workshop, and have **one abstract published in the proceedings of NAPPN 2026**.
