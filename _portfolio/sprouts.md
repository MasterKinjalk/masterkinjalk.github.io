SPROUTS (Smart Phenotyping of Roots: Optimized User-friendly Tools) is a unified desktop application that combines a state-of-the-art deep learning pipeline with interactive visualization in a single workflow. It streamlines import and organization of minirhizotron imagery, interactive enhancement (e.g. CLAHE), human annotation, and AI-powered trait extraction so biologists can go from raw image to discovery without programming expertise.
