**SPROUTS: An Integrated Desktop Application for High-Throughput Root Phenotyping**

Long-term challenges in phenotyping plant roots in the field have limited scalability; researchers often rely on multiple, disconnected tools, and many deep learning solutions require programming expertise. **SPROUTS** (Smart Phenotyping of Roots: Optimized User-friendly Tools) is a unified desktop application that combines a state-of-the-art deep learning pipeline with interactive visualization in a single workflow. It addresses (1) **import and organization** of minirhizotron imagery by date, tube, and depth; (2) **interactive image enhancement** (e.g. contrast/CLAHE) and human annotation; and (3) **AI-powered trait extraction** using **Pix2PixRoot** for image-to-skeleton translation and **RootSeg-ResNet** for root area (mIoU 0.73). Its human-in-the-loop design combines AI speed with expert validation. SPROUTS streamlines the entire image-to-trait workflow so biologists can go from raw image to biological discovery in a single session without computational expertise.

With Sebastian Varela and Andrew D.B. Leakey. Presented as an extended abstract at the [Computer Vision for Plant Phenotyping and Agriculture (CVPPA) workshop](https://cvppa2025.github.io/proceedings/) at ICCV 2025 (October 20, 2025).
